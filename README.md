# What is this?

I'm building a replacement editor environment for myself.

1. for learning
2. for fun
3. to have a vim-like, editing environment that does exactly what I want it to do on any platform I'm going to program on. I want to run `make` and have my editor up and running without relying on ruby, python, and whatever other nonsense vim requires me to have.
